/**
 * Problem 28: N-Queens Problem
 * Topic: Backtracking
 *
 * Description:
 * The N-Queens problem is the challenge of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N 
 * chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.
 *
 * A queen can attack horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. Therefore, 
 * no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.
 *
 * Your task is to return all distinct solutions to the N-Queens problem.
 *
 * Input:
 * - An integer n (1 <= n <= 9), representing the size of the chessboard 
 *   and the number of queens to place.
 *
 * Output:
 * - An array of solutions, where each solution is represented by an array 
 *   of strings. Each string represents a row of the chessboard:
 *   - 'Q' denotes a queen.
 *   - '.' denotes an empty space.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: n = 4
 *   Output: [
 *     [".Q..",
 *      "...Q",
 *      "Q...",
 *      "..Q."],
 *
 *     ["..Q.",
 *      "Q...",
 *      "...Q",
 *      ".Q.."]
 *   ]
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: n = 1
 *   Output: [["Q"]]
 *
 * Instructions:
 * - Implement the solution inside the function below using backtracking.
 * - Do not modify the function name.
