/**
 * Problem 22: GCD and LCM
 * Topic: Math
 *
 * Description:
 * Given two positive integers `a` and `b`, write a function to find:
 * - The Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.
 * - The Least Common Multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
 *
 * The GCD of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides 
 * both numbers without leaving a remainder.
 * The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible 
 * by both numbers.
 *
 * Input:
 * - Two positive integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).
 *
 * Output:
 * - An object or array containing two values: [gcd, lcm].
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: a = 12, b = 18
 *   Output: [6, 36]
 *   Explanation:
 *     GCD(12, 18) = 6
 *     LCM(12, 18) = 36
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: a = 5, b = 10
 *   Output: [5, 10]
 *
 * Example 3:
 *   Input: a = 7, b = 13
 *   Output: [1, 91]
 *
 * Instructions:
 * - Implement the solution inside the function below.
 * - Do not modify the function name.
